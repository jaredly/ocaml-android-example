# Getting started

- use opam because ocaml isn't relocatable :( :( :(
- follow instructions on here https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-android

# Building

- run `./build.sh`
- then go into `example-project` and run `./gradlew installDebug` (assuming you have an emulator running or your phone plugged in)
